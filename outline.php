                                    This hands-on course follows on from <a href=#>COMP 1850</a> Applied Web Development Level 1.
                                    Students who already understand HTML and CSS will explore web development in more depth with
                                    new topics and techniques.
                                    Participants will gain a deeper understanding of the latest technologies including HTML5 and
                                    CSS3 for developing web sites and applications.
                                    There is a focus on responsive design and mobile presentation through the use of Media Queries.
                                    Adding behavior to web sites using JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery is introduced. Labs and
                                    exercises focus on industry standard web development methodology.
                                    Students gain experience creating templates for content management systems and presentation.
                                    Additional topics will include: source control for managing your code, and web-based fonts for
                                    professional typography.

                                    By the end of this course successful students will be able to build dynamic and semantically
                                    marked-up content that is viewable on mobile and desktop screen sizes.
